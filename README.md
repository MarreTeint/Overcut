# Overcut
This is my first web project. It was made at Polytech Paris Saclay, during my first year (out of three) of engineer studies.

## Presentation
With the rise in popularity of Formula 1 over the last few years, particularly linked to the Netflix series, I thought it would be interesting to make a site related to this theme. This means that we need to collect the data that is mandatory in this type of sport (standings, race results, times, etc.). In addition, in order to stand out from other sites, part of the site should be dedicated to a community aspect. This community aspect could also allow people who do not necessarily follow the category to understand it and to be interested in it.

## Specification
### Objective
To make a site gathering data on Formula 1 (standings, race results, ...) and to have a community aspect (discussion space, ...).

    - [x] Paying attention to password management
  - [x] Having administrators to handle problematic posts

### Optional constraints
- [ ] Have biographies on the Drivers and circuits
- [ ] Extend to other race categories
- [ ] Have a polling system
- [ ] Have a live chat
- [ ] Have a "My Team" mini-game

## Project status
Today, the mandatory constraints of the project are completed. The optional constraints remain to be developed. However, the site now includes all the functionalities necessary for its proper functioning.

I will not elaborate further on this website.

## How to have a quick look at the project
You can have a look of how the project work at the webpage [marreteintproject.epizy.com](https://marreteintproject.epizy.com/)

## How to install
1. Put the **htdocs folder** where there should be your website.
2. Create a database and import the **app3.sql** file on it.
3. You may need to adapt the **htdocs/bdd.php** file to make it work properly on your database.
4. Enjoy !
